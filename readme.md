## d2QoL
Median XL's end-game requires highly repetitive crafting mechanics. Working with the cube slowly not only eats away at game time, but can also cause physical stress on the wrists and fingers. Since the nature of these actions is so well defined, it makes perfect target for automation. This was designed foremost as a crafting QoL utility, but it easily extends out to enhance normal gameplay.

This utility does nothing more than clicks on command in locations you have specified. There is no memory peeking, no gameplay logic, nothing outside the capabilities a human can perform.

### Install
Download [d2qol.exe](build/d2qol.exe).

### Usage
Run d2qol.exe **as administrator**. The program will immediately exit if this condition is not true.  
Make sure to set Cube location and Transmute location for your own setup, as various actions rely on these coordinates.  
Hotkeys only active when the Diablo II window is focused.  
Hotkeys are enabled/disabled via checkbox.  
On exiting the program, settings are saved to *d2qol.json* in the running directory.

### Gui
The GUI offers configuration for the various actions and settings. Clicking the buttons will prompt with further configuration input.

### Known Issues
**Settings not saving properly**  
First quit the program, then delete the config file *d2qol.json*.

This was designed and tested under 800x600 resolution and DDraw. I've had reports of fullscreen having some issues with certain actions. Everything is based on user defined x,y locations, and the sequence of UI commands is nearly identical to human execution. *What can go wrong?â„¢*
